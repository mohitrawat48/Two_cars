/*

	Description: It takes in 15-bit input data, and extends it to 24-bit RGB value
 		required by VGA monitor.
Purpose: We compressed the 24-bit RGB values from the sprite to 16-bit data
 	      in order to fit one pixel at one address of SRAM. We lose some color
      accuracy but itâ€™s not noticeable. The compressed version of 24-bit
      RGB is made by taking 5 MSBs of Red, 6 MSBs of Green, and 5
      MSBs of Blue. The RGB_extender appends zeros at relevant positions    
      In the 16-bit data and makes it a 24-bit for VGA monitor.
